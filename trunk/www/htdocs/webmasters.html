		<p>We are a loose collective of enthusiasts who are passionate about transforming 
		the World Wide Web from being simply about publishing text to publishing machine 
		readable data too. We would like to encourage you to adopt <a href="http://linkeddata.org/">Linked Data</a>
		on your website and we are volunteering our skills, experience and enthusiasm to help you. 
		To do this we would like to request permission to copy a portion of your site's content 
		so we can develop the corresponding Linked Data. Once we have converted the data 
		we would like to create some demonstration applications and mashups that would 
		show the benefit of the Linked Data approach. We would need to host the data publicly to enable this. 
		We can do this on temporary basis on our website or we could work with you to 
		host it on your site. You would, of course, retain ownership of your content and data at all stages.</p>
 
		<p>You may have heard Tim Berners-Lee talk about his ideas and vision for connecting all the world's data. 
		He delivered <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html">a great TED talk</a>
		 last year which explains the power of the Linked Data 
		approach for achieving this next version of the web.
		Data published using this method can be re­used very easily and flexibly. It can be copied and moved from system to system and easily aggregated, combined and republished. Crucially however, in Linked Data the original source of the data can always be identified, and any locally held or re­published copy of the information can be verified with the original publisher. Every data item published in this way carries a link with it automatically attributing you as the originator and publisher. This is a unique aspect of the Linked Data approach and it means that no matter how the data is used it always points people back to your website.</p>

		<p>Already several leading organisations have adopted Linked Data as their 
		preferred method of sharing data. These include <a href="http://data.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a>, 
		the <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">UK Government</a>, the <a href="http://id.loc.gov">Library of Congress</a> 
		and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/developers">the BBC</a>. 
		The New York Times see Linked Data as making their content more discoverable and a way to 
		extend the reach of their content beyond its traditional boundaries. At the launch event for the publication 
		of the Times Index as Linked Data they described their thinking:</p>
		<blockquote><p>We reached this decision because we realized that the Times index is really a treasure map. Its our content that’s the treasure, so putting the map out there will only encourage intrepid explorers to plumb the depths of our archives. So with this as our motivating vision, we conceived the following linked data strategy.</p></blockquote>

		<p>The Linked Data approach doesn't mean rebuilding your website. The BBC have pioneered the use of Linked Data 
		without compromising their design. For example their <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/species/Lion">Wildlife Finder</a> site also contains 
		Linked Data that can be reused by developers to create new and innovative applications and services.
		We would like to share the techniques and ideas that can make this possible for your website too.</p>

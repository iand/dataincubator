Data Incubator is focussed on creating and publishing [Linked Data](http://linkeddata.org/), particularly where that data is converted from pre-existing sources. Its approach is to organise people around popular datasets to create mappings to RDF, write conversion code and publish the resulting data. The goal of each of these projects is to use the skill and experience of the community to develop the conversions so the original data provider can very simply adapt the work and emit the linked data themselves.

The [dataincubator.org](http://dataincubator.org/) domain is available for use by data being incubated in a project.

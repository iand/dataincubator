LINKED PERIODICALS DATA CONVERSION

This project contains some ruby scripts for converting journal metadata into RDF. The metadata is sourced 
from several websites including the NLM and Highwire.

For background on the motivations for this project see this blog posting from Bruce D'Arcus and the 
relates mailing list discussion:

INSTALLATION:

The ruby code is dependent on the following being available:

* Ruby 1.8.5 (or higher)
* Rake
* Rubygems

You'll need to install those first before proceeding.

The code is also dependent on several rubygems. To install those, from the project directory run:

 rake dependencies

This will invoke the gem install to grab the pho and parseexcel gems (and their dependencies)

RUNNING THE CODE:

The scripts can all be run directly, but can be more easily automated by using the Rake tasks.

For each source of data there are several tasks that do the following tasks:

 * Download (cache) the journal data
 * Convert the data to RDF
 * Upload the data to the Talis Platform

Check the Rakefile for more details.

To quickly convert all the data simply run:

 rake journals

UPLOADING TO THE TALIS PLATFORM:
 
To convert the data and upload to the Platform run:

 rake upload
 
In order to upload to the Platform you'll need to have either your own store, or admin privileges to 
the "periodicals" store. You'll need to set two environment variables: TALIS_USER (your user id) 
and TALIS_PASS (your password). To set the storename to use, use the TALIS_STORE environment 
variable e.g:

 export TALIS_USER=username
 export TALIS_PASS=pass
 export TALIS_STORE=periodicals

Any data in the periodicals store (http://api.talis.com/stores/periodicals) will be immediately 
available as linked data from the Linked Periodicals dataincubator site at:

  http://periodicals.dataincubator.org

                                          Principles used in constructing NACE and followed in SIC (2003)
          Criteria for divisions          1. The main criteria employed in delineating divisions and groups (the two and three
                    and groups               digit categories, respectively) of NACE concern the characteristics of the activities of
                                             the producing units. The major aspects of the activities are:
                                          (i) the character of the goods and services produced,
                                          (ii) the uses to which the goods and services are put, and
                                          (iii) the inputs, the process, and the technology of production.

                                          2. The weights assigned to these criteria vary from one SIC area to another. In a number
                                             of instances, for example food manufacturing, the textile, clothing and leather
                                             industries, the production of machinery and equipment and the service industries,
                                             the criteria are so close that the problem of assigning weights is not significant.

                                          3. In the case of intermediate products, physical composition and the stage of
                                             fabrication of the items are often given the greatest weight.

                                          4. In the case of goods with complicated production processes, the end-use, technology
                                             and organisation of production of the items are frequently given priority over the
                                             physical composition of the goods.

             Criteria for classes         5. The criteria concerning the manner in which activities are combined in, and
                                             allocated among, enterprises are central in the definition of classes (four digit
                                             categories). They are intended to ensure that it will be practical most of the time to
                                             use the classes of NACE for the industrial classification of kind-of-activity units or
                                             enterprises, and that the units falling into each class will be as similar in the kinds
                                             of activity in which they engage as is feasible.

                                          6. The classes of NACE are defined so that, as far as possible, the following two
                                             conditions are satisfied:
                                          (i) the production of the category of goods and services which characterises a given
                                              class accounts for the bulk of the output of the units classified to that class, and
                                          (ii) the class contains the units which produce most of the category of goods and
                                               services which characterise it.

             Kind of ownership            7. NACE does not draw distinctions according to kind of ownership, type of legal
                                             organisation or mode of operation because such criteria do not relate to the
                                             characteristics of the activity itself. Units engaged in the same kind of economic
                                             activity are classified in the same way, irrespective of whether they are incorporated
                                             enterprises, individual proprietors or government, and whether or not the parent
                                             enterprise consists of more than one unit.

                                          8. Classifications according to kind of legal ownership, kind of organisation or mode
                                             of operation may be constructed independently of the activity classification.
                                             Cross-classification with NACE will provide useful extra information.

                                          9. Similarly, manufacturing units are classified according to the principal kind of
                                             economic activity in which they engage, whether the work is performed by
                                             power-driven machinery or by hand or whether it is done in a factory or in a
                                             household. Whether the production process is modern or traditional is not a criterion.

        Market and non-market             10. In the structure of NACE Rev.1.1 the distinction between market and non-market
                                              activities is not a consideration, even though this had been the case in NACE 1970.
                                              There are some classes in NACE Rev.1.1 that are normally non-market, for example,
                                              certain classes of division 75. There are several others which define both market and
                                              non-market activities.

                                 Definitions
                                 Definition of activities
                    Activity     11. An activity is said to take place when resources such as equipment, labour,
                                     manufacturing techniques, information networks or products are combined, leading
                                     to the creation of specific goods or services. An activity is characterised by an input
                                     of products (goods or services), a production process and an output of products.

                                 12. In practice, the majority of production units perform activities of a mixed character.
                                     The identification of a principal activity is necessary to allocate a unit to a particular
                                     NACE Rev.1.1 heading.

          Principal activity     13. The principal activity is identified by the top-down method (see paragraphs 34–44)
                                     ideally based on the value added although other criteria such as employment are
                                     often used in practice. The principal activity so identified does not necessarily
                                     account for 50% or more of the business’ total value added.

        Secondary activity       14. A secondary activity is any other activity of the business that produces goods
                                     or services.

        Ancillary activities     15. Principal and secondary activities are generally carried out with the support of
                                     a number of ancillary activities such as accounting, transportation, storage,
                                     purchasing, sales promotion, and repair and maintenance. Ancillary activities
                                     are those that exist solely to support the main productive activities by providing
                                     non-durable goods or services.

                                 16. However, if the activities of the statistical unit and the corresponding ancillary
                                     activities, for example, a computing centre, are carried out in different geographical
                                     areas, it may be desirable to collect separate information on these units for the
                                     categories of data which have to be classified in terms of geographical area.

       What is an ancillary      17. An ancillary activity must satisfy the following conditions:
                  activity?
                                 (a) it serves only the unit or units referred to and its goods or services must not be sold
                                     on the market;
                                 (b) a comparable activity on a similar scale is performed in similar production units;
                                 (c) it produces services or, in exceptional cases, non-durable goods which do not form
                                     part of the unit’s end product;
                                 (d) it contributes to the current costs of the unit itself, that is, it does not generate gross
                                     fixed capital formation.

  What is not an ancillary       18. It should be noted that under the above definition the following are not to be
                 activity?           regarded as ancillary activities:
                                 (a) producing goods and services that are part of capital formation. For example,
                                     construction work for own account would be separately classified to construction if
                                     data were available;
                                 (b) production a significant part of which is sold commercially, even if much of it is
                                     consumed in connection with principal activities;
                                 (c) the production of goods which subsequently become an integral part of the output
                                     of the principal or secondary activity (for example, production of boxes by a
                                     department of an enterprise for packing its products);
                                 (d) the production of energy (an integrated power station or coking plant), even though
                                     the whole output is consumed by the parent unit;
                                 (e) the purchase of goods for resale in an unaltered state;
                                 (f) research and development, as this activity does not provide a service that is con-
                                     sumed in the course of current production.
                                                                                                                                   9
Rules for classifying statistical units                       UK Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities 2003 – SIC(2003)




                                          19. In all these cases, where separate data are available for these activities, separate units
                                              should be distinguished and they should be recognised as kind-of-activity units and
                                              classified according to their principal activity.

                                          Statistical units
                Data availability         20. A wide range of information is required to construct a complete statistical picture of
                                              industrial activity, but the organisational level at which it is feasible to assemble the
                                              information varies according to the type of data. For example, profits data for a
                                              company may be available from only one geographically central location in respect
                                              of several different locations, whereas product sales data may be available in respect
                                              of each of the separate locations. To observe and analyse the data satisfactorily it is,
                                              therefore, necessary to define a family of statistical units. These form the building
                                              blocks for the allocation of the appropriate classification in respect of which data
                                              can be collected.

                 Different types          21. Different types of statistical units meet different needs, but each unit is a specific
                                              entity, which is defined in such a way that it can be recognised and identified and not
                                              confused with any other unit. It may be an identifiable legal or physical entity or, as
                                              for example in the case of the unit of homogeneous production, a statistical construct.

                   International          22. In order to ensure international comparability the definitions adopted for use
                  comparability               within the European Union are linked directly to those given in the introduction to
                                              the United Nations International Standard Industrial classification of All Economic
                                              Activities (ISIC Rev 3.1) and the United Nations System of National Accounts.

                        The units         23. The following are the units that are described in the Council Regulation on
                                              statistical units1:
                                          ■   the enterprise group;
                                          ■   the enterprise;
                                          ■   the kind-of-activity unit (KAU);
                                          ■   the local unit;
                                          ■   the local kind-of-activity unit (local KAU);
                                          ■   the institutional unit;
                                          ■   the unit of homogeneous production (UHP);
                                          ■   the local unit of homogeneous production (local UHP).

                                          24. The relationship between the different types of statistical units is illustrated in the

UK Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities 2003 – SIC(2003)                  Rules for classifying statistical units




                                 Classification rules for units
                                 25. The units included in statistical registers2 are classified by NACE Rev.1.1. The
                                     interpretation of NACE Rev.1.1 is helped by the addition of explanatory notes, by
                                     decisions of the NACE Rev.1.1 management committee, by correspondence tables,
                                     and by reference to other classification systems such as the CPC, CPA, HS, and CN3.

                                 26. Each unit is classified on the basis of the activities carried out within it. In certain
                                     cases, a unit cannot be classified separately as links with other units may have to be
                                     taken into consideration.

                                 27. Units should be classified to the category that best describes their activity, taking
                                     into account not only the output structure but also the input structure, including
                                     the production process.

                                 Basic classification rules
               Value-added       28. Value added is the basic concept for the determination of the classification of a
                                     unit according to its economic activity. Being the difference between output and
                                     intermediate consumption, value added is an additive measure of the contribution
                                     of each economic unit to Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The relevant valuation
                                     concept is gross value added at basic prices. Gross value added at basic prices is
                                     defined as the difference between output at basic prices and intermediate
                                     consumption at purchaser’s prices. Thus, value added at basic prices consists of
                                     other taxes on production, net compensation of employees, consumption of fixed
                                     capital and an operating surplus balancing item.

                                 29. Economic activities are defined in NACE Rev.1.1. A unit may perform one or more
                                     economic activities falling under one or more positions in NACE Rev.1.1. Units are
                                     classified according to their principal activity. The principal activity is the activity
                                     which contributes most to the value added of the unit at basic prices.

   Within one NACE class         30. In the simple case where, at class level, a unit performs only one activity, the activity
                                     classification of that unit is determined by the position of NACE Rev.1.1 which
                                     covers the activity of that unit. Where a unit, at class level, performs more than one
                                     activity but all of them fall under the same position of NACE Rev.1.1, then the
                                     activity classification of that unit is determined by the position of NACE Rev.1.1 in
                                     which all these activities are covered.

        In different classes     31. In the case where, at class level, a unit performs activities falling under different
                                     positions of NACE Rev.1.1, rules are necessary for the determination of the principal
                                     activity. In the simple case that, at class level, one activity accounts for more than
                                     50% of value added, this determines the classification of the unit.

                                 32. Where a unit performs activities falling in only two different positions of NACE
                                     Rev.1.1, there will always be one position which accounts for more than 50% of
                                     value added, except in the highly unlikely case that both activities of the different
                                     positions of NACE Rev.1.1 have equal shares of 50%.

                                 33. In the more complex case where a unit performs more than two activities falling

             Top-down method              34. The top-down method follows a hierarchical principle. The classification of a unit
                                              at the lowest level of the classification must be consistent with the classification of
                                              the unit at the higher levels. To satisfy this condition, the process starts with the
                                              identification of the relevant position at the highest level and progresses down
                                              through the levels of the classification in the following way:

                                               ■   Identify the section which has the highest share of the value added.
                                               ■   Within this section, identify the division which has the highest share of the value
                                                   added.
                                               ■   Within this division, identify of the group which has the highest share of the
                                                   valued added.
                                               ■   Within this group, identify of the class which has the highest share of value
                                                   added.

         The principle activity           35. The principal activity is, therefore, 29.53 Manufacture of machinery for food,
                                              beverage and tobacco processing, although the class with the biggest share of value
                                              added is class: 51.88 Wholesale of agricultural machinery and accessories and
                                              implements, including tractors.

                                          36. If the allocation had been made directly to the class with the largest share of value
                                              added this would have achieved the strange result of putting this enterprise outside
                                              manufacturing.

       All levels consistent     37. The top-down method satisfies the principle that the activity classification should be
                                     consistent with the principal activity of the unit at the aggregated level of the activity
                                     classification. At lower levels of the classification the share of value added of the
                                     position of NACE Rev.1.1 that results from using the top-down method will not
                                     necessarily account for more than 50% of total valued added of that unit. It is also
                                     possible at the highest hierarchical level of NACE Rev.1.1 for no position to account
                                     for more than 50% of value added.

           To what level do      38. The top-down method permits determination of the principal activity of a unit down
              you descend?           to the lowest level of the hierarchical activity classification. In practice, the NACE
                                     Rev.1.1 regulation itself does not stipulate the use of a certain hierarchical level.

      When value-added is        39. In order to determine the principal activity of a unit the shares of value added for
               unknown               the activities falling under different positions of NACE Rev.1.1 of that unit have to be
                                     known. However, in practice, it is often not possible to obtain information on value
                                     added for the different activities performed and the determination of the activity
                                     classification has to be done by using substitute criteria. Such criteria could be:

                                 Substitutes based on output

                                 ■    gross output of the unit that is attributable to the goods or services associated with
                                      each activity;

                                 ■    value of sales of those groups of products falling within each activity.

                                 Substitutes based on input

                                 ■    wages and salaries attributable to the different activities;

                                 ■    employment in the different activities of the unit.

          But they are only      40. The use of substitute criteria does not change the methods for determining the
           approximations            principal activity nor the rules of the top-down method. The substitutes are only
                                     operational approximations of value added data.

                                 41. However, simple use of substitutes may sometimes be misleading. This will always
                                     be the case when the structure of the substitute criteria is not proportional to the
                                     (unknown) value added.

    Problems with output         42. Using the sales (turnover) criteria, it immediately becomes evident that in certain
              substitutes            cases the proportionality of turnover and value added is not valid. For example,
                                     trade turnover usually has a much lower share of value added than, say, a
                                     manufacturing activity. Other examples of cases where turnover is not a good
                                     proxy are turnover of forwarding agents or of general contractors. Even within
                                     manufacturing, the relation between sales and the resulting value added may vary
                                     between and within activities. In some cases, a turnover figure makes no sense or
                                     does not exist, for example for financial intermediation activities and insurance
                                     activities. The same considerations should be borne in mind when using gross
                                     output data as substitute criteria.

                                 43. Many units perform trade and other activities. In such cases, trade turnover figures
                                     are the most unsuitable indicators for value added. A much better indicator is the
                                     gross margin (the difference between the trade turnover and purchases of goods for
                                     resale adjusted by changes in stocks). However, trade margins may vary between
                                     wholesale and retail trade and also within a single trade activity area. In addition,
                                     the specific classification rules for retail trade as set out in paragraphs 66–74, must
                                     be considered.



                                                                                                                                13

          Problems with input             44. Similar precautions have to be considered when input based substitute criteria are
                  substitutes                 applied. The proportionality between wages and salaries or employment and value
                                              added is not reliable if the capital intensity of the various activities is different.
                                              Higher capital intensity normally implies higher depreciation and a lower share of
                                              wages and salaries in value added. Capital intensity varies substantially between
                                              different economic activities and also between activities of the same NACE Rev.1.1
                                              class. For example, the activity of manufacturing splints will probably have a lower
                                              capital intensity than the manufacture of pacemakers. However, both fall into the
                                              same NACE Rev.1.1 class (33.10).

                                          Activity specific rules
                                          45. The basic rules for determining the principal activity of a statistical unit are set out
                                              above. There are, however, certain economic processes and phenomena which need
                                              to be defined clearly if statistical units are to be treated in a uniform way. These
                                              definitions feature in this section.

                                          46. Vertical integration of activities occurs where the different stages of production are
                                              carried out in succession by the same unit and where the output of one process
                                              serves as input to the next, for example, tree felling combined with saw milling, a
                                              clay pit combined with a brickworks, or production of synthetic fibres associated
                                              with a textile mill.

                                          47. A unit with a vertically integrated chain of activities should generally be classified to
                                              the activity that contributes most to the value added of the goods or services
                                              produced. However, for practical reasons of data availability, it is often the final
                                              output that is decisive.

                                          48. The approach above also applies in the special case of horizontally integrated units,
                                              that is, units where several types of activities are carried out simultaneously using
                                              the same factors of production but cannot be segregated into separate statistical
                                              units (for example, manufacture of bakery products combined with manufacture of
                                              chocolate confectionery).

     Activities under-taken on            49. Units carrying out an activity on a fee or contract basis are classified with units
         a fee or contract basis              producing the same goods or services on their own account. There are two basic types:

                                          Work based on plans
                                              Work based on plans, where the contractor provides the subcontractor with all the
                                              technical specifications required for the production of the product he has ordered.
                                              This situation is found, in particular, in the metals sector (forging, cutting, stamping
                                              and foundry work);

                                          Work done to order
                                              Work done to order, where the subcontractor carries out a special process on an
                                              object provided by the contractor. The object can be anything from raw material to
                                              a machined mechanical part. Examples include the processing of metals (chrome
                                              plating) and the preparation of fruit for canning.

                      Converters          50. Converters are units which sell goods or services under their own name, but arrange
                                              for their production by others. These units are classified to Sector G (wholesale and
                                              retail) except when they own the legal right to produce the goods or services and the
                                              production concept, in which case they are classified as if they produce the goods or
                                              services themselves.

            On-site installation          51. Units principally engaged in the installation or assembly of any items or equipment
                  and assembly                necessary for a building to function as such are classified to construction (division
                                              45). This covers such items as heating and ventilation equipment, lifts and escalators,
                                              electricity, gas and water supply, windows and doors.

                                 52. Installation and assembly normally also includes start-up services, including all
                                     work necessary to ensure trouble-free operation on site, any basic instruction of the
                                     operatives and maintenance of the equipment.

                                 53. Installation that is performed as a service incidental to the sale of equipment, for
                                     example, the installation of domestic electrical equipment by the retailer, is an
                                     associated activity and is classified in the same way as the main activity.

  Repair and maintenance         54. Units that repair, maintain or overhaul equipment are classified to the same class as
                                     the units that produce it except that:

                                 ■    units that repair or maintain motor vehicles and motorcycles are classified to groups
                                      50.2 and 50.4 respectively;

                                 ■    units that repair personal and household goods are classified to group 52.7;

                                 ■    units that repair or maintain domestic central heating boilers and burners are
                                      classified to class 45.33;

                                 ■    units that repair or maintain computers and office equipment are classified to group
                                      72.5.


                                 Section specific rules and definitions
                                 Section G: Wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and
                                            personal and household goods
        Definition of trade      55. In NACE Rev.1.1, wholesale and retail trade comprises all units whose principal
                                     economic activity involves purchasing transportable goods and reselling them and/
                                     or acting as an agent between sellers and buyers of goods. Such goods are subject
                                     only to handling and packaging; they are not transformed in any substantial way.

                                 56. Wholesale and retail trade comprises not only direct trading between two parties,
                                     but also that arranged on behalf of one or more third parties. It is, however, essential
                                     that the main activity should be that of trading products that have not been altered
                                     more than as is customary by the seller.

            Definition of        57. Handling that is customary in trade does not affect the basic character of the
      Customary handling             merchandise and may include, for example, sorting, separating, mixing and packaging.

                                 58. In wholesale trade, there are a number of branches of economic activity where the
                                     handling customary in trade is of considerable importance. A typical example is the
                                     repackaging of products before delivery to the retailer.

                                 59. Also included are services in support of the sale of products such as the delivery and
                                     installation of electrical appliances.

                                 60. Commission trade and wholesale trade are combined in one division in NACE
                                     Rev.1.1. The commission trade classes form one group (51.1), while the wholesale
                                     trade classes are allocated to six groups (51.2-51.9). A separate division comprises
                                     retail trade, within which there are six groups for different aspects of retail trade and
                                     an additional one for the repair of personal and household goods. The motor
                                     vehicles trade, together with the maintenance and repair of motor vehicles and the
                                     retail sale of automotive fuel, forms division 50.

           Definition of         61. Group 51.1, wholesale commission trade, comprises all units whose principal
        Commission trade             activity is trading goods on behalf of third parties. They may be commercial agents
                                     or brokers or trading associations conducting transactions on third party account,
                                     but retail commission trade is not shown separately. It is classified to the relevant
                                     class of division 52.
                                                                                                                               15
Rules for classifying statistical units                      UK Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities 2003 – SIC(2003)




                  Definition of           62. The wholesale trade groups comprise all units whose economic activity consists
                Wholesale trade               primarily in reselling merchandise in their own name to retailers, industrial,
                                              commercial, institutional or professional users or to other wholesalers.

                                          63. Wholesale trade is classified only by the range of products. Other criteria are not
                                              taken into account, for example, whether it is domestic wholesale trade or import
                                              and/or export trade.

     Definition of Retail trade           64. The retail trade groups 52.1 to 52.6 of NACE Rev.1.1 comprise all units whose
                                              economic activity consists primarily of selling goods on own or third party account
                                              predominantly to households.

                                          65. Retail trade is mostly carried out in premises accessible to anyone. There are, however,
                                              other forms of retail activity such as mail, telephone or internet selling, trading from
                                              mobile vehicles and from temporary locations and repository services.

         How to classify within           66. Retail trade is classified first by type of sale outlet (retail trade in stores: groups
                   Retail trade               52.1 to 52.5; retail trade not in stores: group 52.6). Retail trade in stores is further
                                              subdivided into retail sale of new goods (groups 52.1 to 52.4) and retail sale of used
                                              goods (group 52.5). For retail sale of new goods in stores there exists a further
                                              distinction between specialised retail sale (groups 52.2 to 52.4) and non-specialised
                                              retail sale (group 52.1). Specialised retail sale of new goods in stores is subdivided by
                                              the range of products sold. These subdivisions have to be considered as additional
                                              levels and have to be applied when using the top down method.

                 Kind of service          67. No attempt is made to reflect other possible aspects of retail activity such as the kind
                                              of service (for example traditional service or self-service), outlets run by voluntary
                                              services or purchasing associations, or the distinction between co-operative and
                                              other retail trade.

                                          68. Units whose main activity in terms of value added is obviously retail trade from
                                              shop premises have to be allocated to one of the classes 52.11 to 52.50. Having
                                              determined the range of products sold by the individual units, allocation should be
                                              made according to the rules set out in the following paragraphs.

                  Only one class          69. If the products sold comprise exclusively those of one NACE Rev.1.1 class, allocation
                                              is obviously to that class. Example: A unit sells only beverages on its shop premises.
                                              The unit is wholly allocated to class 52.25.

                                     in terms of value added. In this case, the unit should be allocated to that class.
                                 Examples:        (a) 52.41 – 20%               b) 52.21 – 10%
                                                      52.42 – 30%                  52.24 – 10%

                                                                                   52.33 – 15%
                                                                                   52.41 – 55%

                                 71. If the products sold comprise several NACE Rev.1.1 classes, none of which accounts
                                     for a share of 50% or more in terms of value added, further analysis is necessary to
                                     establish the relevant allocation. For this, the top down method has to be used by
                                     considering the additional retail levels mentioned above.

Specialised/non-specialised      72. When choosing between specialised retail trade 52.2 – 52.4 and non-specialised
                                     retail trade 52.1 the outcome will depend on the number of NACE Rev.1.1 classes
                                     involved, and the way in which activity is distributed across those classes.

         Up to four classes      73. If the products sold comprise up to four classes of NACE Rev.1.1 groups 52.2 and/or
                                     52.3 and/or 52.4, none of which accounts for a share of 50% or more in terms of
                                     value added, but each represents 5% or more of value added, a specialised trade is
                                     still involved. It is then necessary to determine only the focus of the activities on the
                                     basis of value added. The main activity, selecting first the main group and then the
                                     class within that group, will then determine the allocation.
                                                       52.21 – 30%                 52.21 – 30%               52.21 – 20%

                                                       Allocation to 52.31         Allocation to 52.21       Allocation to 52.43

       Five or more classes      74. If the products sold comprise five or more classes of groups 52.2, 52.3 and 52.4, each
                                     representing 5% or more of value added, but none of which accounts for a share of
                                     50% or more, this should be classified as a non-specialised store and allocated to
                                     group 52.1. If food, beverages and tobacco represent at least 35% of value added,
                                     allocation will be made to NACE Rev.1.1 class 52.11. In all other cases, allocation
                                     should be to class 52.12.
                                                       52.21 – 5%                  52.21 – 20%               52.21 – 5%
                                                       52.22 – 10%                 52.22 – 15%               52.22 – 5%

                                                       52.33 – 25%                 52.33 – 10%               52.33 – 40%
                                                       52.44 – 45%                 52.44 – 45%               52.44 – 10%

                                 Note: The allocation rules are always based on the retail activity of the unit. If, in
                                 addition to its retail trade, a unit has a secondary activity which also provides services

                                                                                                                                 17

                                          or produces goods, the allocation of the unit to the appropriate class of division 52 is
                                          determined by the composition of its retail activity only.

                                          Section L: Public administration
                                          75. The classification criteria used in the private sector are also applied to government
                                              bodies. Consequently, not all government bodies are classified to Section L. Units
                                              carrying out activities at the national, regional or local levels that are specifically
                                              attributable to other areas of NACE Rev.1.1 are classified in the appropriate section
                                              (for example, education in Section M, health and social work in Section N) rather
                                              than in Section L Public administration and defence; compulsory social security.

                                              For example, a higher education establishment administered by central or local
                                              government is allocated to class 80.30 and a hospital similarly administered is
                                              allocated to class 85.11.

                                          Section P: Private households employing domestic staff and undifferentiated
                                          production activities of households for own use
                                          76. Class 95.00 includes the activities of private households employing domestic
                                              personnel only. The result of this activity is considered production by the national
                                              accounts system and for this purpose and for certain surveys this class has been
                                              included in NACE Rev.1.1. The domestic personnel themselves should not be
                                              classified in classes 95.00.

                                          77. Based on ISIC Rev.3.1, two new divisions were included in NACE Rev. 1.1 (division
                                              96 Undifferentiated goods-producing activities of private households for own use
                                              and division 97 Undifferentiated service-producing activities of private households
                                              for own use) in order to cover all production activities, even if only done by private
                                              households for their own use.

                                          78. These divisions would normally not be relevant in business statistics, but would be
                                              needed for data collections covering business statistics, household and subsistence
                                              activities.

                                          Changes in the classification of units
                                          79. The principal activity may change suddenly from one statistical period to the next,
                                              either because of seasonal factors or because of a management decision to vary the
                                              pattern of output. Alternatively, a change in the pattern of output or sales may take
                                              place gradually over several years. In each case, the classification of the unit should
                                              be changed, but too frequent changes distort statistics and make interpretation
                                              extremely difficult.

                                          80. To avoid frequent changes, it is necessary to have a stability rule. Without such a rule
                                              there would be apparent changes in the economic demography of the business
                                              population which would be no more than statistical artifacts. The working rule is
                                              that the formerly secondary activity should exceed the activity to which the unit is
                                              currently classified for two years before the classification is changed.

                                          81. Changes in the classification of units for the purposes of statistical inquiries should
                                              not be made more than once a year, either at fixed dates or as the information
                                              becomes available. More frequent changes would result in inconsistency between
                                              short term (monthly and quarterly) and longer term statistics.

                                 Glossary
                                 82. This glossary gives a further description of some of the terms used throughout the
                                     NACE Rev.1.1 Introduction, Annex and Explanatory Notes. Every attempt has been
                                     made to ensure that the descriptions are consistent with the definitions of the terms
                                     when used elsewhere, but these descriptions are not intended to give all-purpose
                                     definitive meanings of the words. The purpose of this glossary is merely to help the
                                     user of NACE Rev.1.1 to interpret it correctly.

               By-products       83. An exclusive by-product is a product technologically linked to the production of
                                     other products in the same group, but which is not produced in any other group
                                     (for example, molasses linked to the production of sugar). Exclusive by-products
                                     are used as inputs for the manufacture of other products.

                                 84. An ordinary by-product (that is, a by-product which is not exclusive to a single
                                     group) is a product technologically linked to the production of other products, but
                                     which is produced in several groups (for example, the hydrogen produced during
                                     petroleum refining is technologically linked to that produced in petrochemical
                                     manufacture and coal carbonization and identical to that produced in the group
                                     comprising other basic chemical products).

              Capital goods      85. Capital goods are goods, other than material inputs and fuel, used for the production
                                     of other goods and/or services. They include factory buildings, machinery,
                                     locomotives, lorries and tractors. Land is not usually regarded as a capital good.

                Commodity        86. A commodity is a transportable good that may be exchanged. It may be one of a run
                                     from a production line, a unique item (Mona Lisa) or the material medium for a
                                     service (software diskette). This is the concept used for customs classifications.

         Industrial process      87. An industrial process is a transformation process whether physical, chemical,
                                     manual, or whatever, used in the manufacture of new products (whether consumer,
                                     intermediate or investment goods), in the processing of used products or in the
                                     provision of services to industry as defined in Sections C (extractive industries), D
                                     (manufacturing industry), E (production and distribution of Electricity, gas and
                                     water) and F (construction industry).

     Machinery: domestic         88. Machinery and equipment of a type designed principally for use by private
           or household              households, for example, household washing machines.

    Machinery: industrial        89. Machinery and equipment of a type designed principally for use in non-domestic
                                     premises, for example, machine tools, laundry-type washing machines.

  Manufacturing industry         90. All activities included within Section D. Both cottage industry and large-scale
                                     activities are included. It should be noted that the use of heavy plant or machinery
                                     is not exclusive to Section D.

                    Product      91. A product is the outcome of economic activity. It is the generic term applied to
                                     goods and services.

         Finished products       92. Products for which processing has been completed.

   Semi-finished products        93. Products that have undergone some processing but require further processing
                                     before they are ready for use. They may be sold to other manufacturers for further
                                     processing. Typical examples would include rough metal castings sold for finishing
                                     elsewhere.




                                                                                                                             19

                      Production          94. Production is an activity resulting in a product. It is used with reference to the whole
                                              range of economic activities. The term is not reserved for the agricultural, mining
                                              or manufacturing sectors. It is also used in relation to the service sector. More
                                              specific terms may be used to denote production. Provision of services, processing
                                              and manufacturing are examples, depending on the branch of activity. Production
                                              may be measured in various ways either in physical terms or according to value.

                Transformation            95. Transformation is a process that modifies the nature, composition or form of raw
                                              materials, semi-finished or finished products for the purpose of obtaining new
                                              products.

                       Treatment          96. A process that is carried out, inter alia, for the purpose of protecting certain
                                              products, for giving them certain properties or for preventing any harmful effects
                                              that might otherwise result from their use. Examples are the treatment of crops,
                                              wood, metals and waste.

                     Value added          97. The gross value added is the value of gross output less the cost of material and other
                                              intermediate inputs, adjusted for any change in stocks.

                 Mining and quarrying include the extraction of minerals occurring naturally as solids (coal and ores),
                 liquids (petroleum), or gases (natural gas). Extraction can be by underground or surface mining or                              B
                 well operation.

                 This section includes supplementary operations needed to transport and market the mineral products,

                 e.g. crushing, grinding, cleaning, drying, sorting, concentrating ores, liquefaction of natural gas and
                 agglomeration of solid fuels. These operations are often accomplished by the units which extracted the                          CA
                 resource and/or others located nearby.

                                   these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected processes.
CA                                 More than one is often carried carried out in a single unit. There are essentially three activities. The
                                   manufacture of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibres from other impurities in wood or used paper.
CB                                 The manufacture of paper involves matting these fibres into a sheet. Converted paper products are made
                                   from paper and other materials by various cutting and shaping techniques and includes coating and
                                   laminating activities. The paper articles may be printed (e.g. wallpaper, gift wrap, etc.) provided that the

                                 Processes used in printing include a variety of methods used to transfer an image from a plate, screen
                                 or computer file to some medium such as paper, plastics, metal, textile articles or wood. The most
CB                               prominent of these methods is the transfer of an image from a plate or screen to a medium (lithographic,
                                 gravure, screen and flexographic printing). A rapidly growing new technology uses a computer file to
DA                               directly “drive” the printing mechanism to create the image. This new technology also includes new
                                 electrostatic and other types of equipment (digital or non-impact printing).

                 for immediate consumption. The section includes both accommodation and food services because the

                 classified together with sale of meals in 55.3 (Restaurants). Similarly, a restaurant activity is a specific
                 activity but may also be implicitly included in lodgings.                                                                     DA
                 Lodging units provide lodgings or short term accommodation for travellers, holidaymakers and others.                          DB
                 There is a wide range of units. Some provide lodgings only while others also provide meals and recreational
                 facilities. The type of complementary services provided may vary from unit to unit.
                                                                                                                                               DC

UK Standard Industrial Classification of Economic Activities 2003 – SIC(2003)                                                       Explanatory Notes




Section L        Public Administration and Defence; Compulsory Social Security                                                                    A
                 The classification criteria used in the private sector are, by analogy, applied to both local authorities and
                 public administration. Consequently, few government bodies are classified to Section L. The general                              B
                 rule is that operational, as opposed to administrative, policy or similar units, should be classified to the
                 appropriate UK SIC(2003) Section (for example, a primary school in Section M; a National Health Service
                 hospital in Section N). However, purely or mainly administrative, policy or similar units should be classified
                                                                                                                                                  CA
                 to Section L. Where, say, a central government building carries out a mainly administrative function but
                 also has a secondary, but not separately identifiable, operational role it should be classified to Section L.                    CB
                 Mainly operational units, where they are identifiable as such, should always be classified outside Section
